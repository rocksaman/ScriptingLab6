    Bio: "My name is Aman Agarwal and I am an engineering student in Sikkim Manipal Institue of Technology. <br>I am a beginnner in coding and programming, and in future, I would love to use my skills to contribute to the exciting technological advances that happen every day.
     <br>Further I am also sharpening my skills in Ethical Hacking. I am obsessed with all tech-related stuffs and space. <br>I spend my free time acquiring free knowledge about quantum mechanics and string theory and I do often ponder to the thought whether we will be able to travel through space-time. <br>I enjoy watching sci-fi movies, learning languages like Deustch and Spanish, hiking by nearby hills, valleys, feeling the awe while watching the mighty Kanchenjunga, <br>eating exquisite vegeterian delicacies at local restaurants and my favorite hobby, laughing."
